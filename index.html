          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>We think it makes the most sense to approach teaching Scala not as if
it's an improved Java but as a new language. Experience in Java is not
expected. Focus will be around the interpreter and the
object-functional style as well as the style of programming we do
here. An emphasis will be placed on maintainability, clarity of
expression, and leveraging the type system.
