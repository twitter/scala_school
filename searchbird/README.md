# Project Searchbird

Welcome to your searchbird project!  To make sure things are working
properly, you may want to:

    $ sbt update test

There is a tutorial for what to do next, which you can find in the
scala-bootstrapper README.rdoc file.

# Configuring Intellij

If you want to setup Intellij, it has to happen off to the side:

    $ sbt
    > *sbtIdeaRepo at http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/
    > *idea is com.github.mpeltonen sbt-idea-processor 0.4.0
    > update
    > idea

# Documenting your project

Add documentation here!  Eventually, you'll be able to publish this to
a web site for the world to easily find and read.
